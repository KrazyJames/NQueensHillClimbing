# NQueensHillClimbing
A hill climbing algorithm solving the N queens problem
Given a random vector (auto-generated by program) which contains a random permutation of the first eight natural numbers (1 to 8),
this algorithm searches best option possible with the least amount of collisions between queens (h close to 0)
